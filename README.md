# GAT_implementation
PyTorch implementation for Graph Attention Network (GAT) on node classification task.

# NOTICE
I have provided two distinct implementations of the Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, one utilizing DGL (Deep Graph Library) and the other not. The implementation that does not use DGL is limited to handling tasks on small datasets, as it relies on the adjacency matrix of the graph. And the one without DGL has not been fine-tuned.
